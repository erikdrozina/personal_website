Hi, I am Erik Drozina, a 19 year old Italian student passionate about the tech world.

I use Java and C# for coding my free-time apps and I have a good knowledge of C, C++ and Python too, which I'm deepening.

I also have a solid basic knowledge of Linux as OS which I'm currently using to work with Android realated stuff.

For more information check the [certificates page](/certificates).
