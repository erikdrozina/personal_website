Hi, I am Erik Drozina, a 19 year old Italian student passionate about the tech world.

I use Java (Android oriented), C# and Python for coding my free-time apps and I have a good knowledge of C, C++.

I use Linux as Operative System (Pop-Os) on my daily driver laptop which I'm currently using to work with Android realated stuff and school projects.

For more information about my degrees check the [certificates page](/certificates).
