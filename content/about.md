Hi, I am Erik Drozina, a 19 year old Italian student passionate about the tech world.

I use  C#, Java (Android oriented) and Python for coding my free-time apps and I have a basic knowledge of C, C++ studied in high school.

I use Linux as Operative System ([Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/)) on my daily driver computer which I'm currently using to work with Android realated stuff, school projects and other small personal projects.

For more information about my degrees check the [certificates page](/certificates).
