Hi, I am Erik Drozina, a 21 year old Italian developer passionate about the tech world.

I studied C#, Java (Android oriented), Javascript at school, learnt Python and Bash in my free time and have a basic knowledge of C++ from the first years of High School.

In my school career I've studied topics like Windows Server, PLC, Networking, Electronics and Telecomunications, Database (Relational mostly), Linux CLI and Web Development (Back-End mostly).

I use Linux as Operative System (Arch btw) on my daily driver computer which I'm currently using to work with Android related stuff and personal projects.

I am currently discovering the Android world developing and maintaining custom ROMs for my device (Xiaomi Mi Note 10).

For more information about my degrees check the [certificates page](/certificates).
