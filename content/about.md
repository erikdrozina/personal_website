Hi, I am Erik Drozina, a 19 year old italian student passionate about the tech world.

I use Java and C# for coding my free-time apps but I have a basic knowledge of C, C++ and Python, which I'm deepening.

I also have a solid basic knowledge of Linux as OS which I'm currently using to work with Android realated stuff.
